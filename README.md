# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use Unserpervised Machine Learning to analyze a cryptocurrency database in order to determine what currencies are currently being traded on the market.  The analysis then looks at how to group the currencies in order to classify them for client investment portfolios.  The data needed to be processed and filtered prior to being grouped and analyzed.  The result of the data processing yielded 532 cryptocurrencies being currently being traded.  Using the KMeans method to produce an elbow curve, the graph showed that four (4) clusters were best to group the data.  Those clusters were then displayed in both 2D and 3D charts.
